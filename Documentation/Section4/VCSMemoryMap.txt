VCS Memory Mapping

ROM:
	$F000 --------> $FFFF

"Zero Page":
	$0000 --------> $00FF

	In which is split between the TIA registers and RAM, equally.

	But what does all of this mean?
	-------------------------------
	
	When we are talking about a memory map, we are talking about the location as 
	to where things are located in address space.

	In the VCS, we have the VCS buss. In the VCS bus, we have connected three 
	very important things, TIA (Television Interface Adapter), PIA (Peripheral 
	Interface Adapter), and ROM (Read-Only Memory).
	
	Via the TIA we can access the colour of the background that we wish to 
	display, the colour of player sprites, the play-field, etc. 
	
	Our PIA is essentially where all of the system RAM is stored. That is all 
	whopping 256 bytes of it. The PIA is also where the player input is handled.


The Official VCS Memory Map

	TIA Registers:				Cartridge ROM:
		
		$00					$F000
		$01					$F001
		$02					$F002
		 -					  -
		 -					  -
		$7D					$FFFD
		$7E					$FFFE
		$7F					$FFFF
	
	PIA RAM:
	
		$80
		$81
		$82
		 -
		 -
		$FD
		$FE
		$FF

	These are all together 
	our "Zero Page"
	
	

	Do we need to remember all of these addresses?
	----------------------------------------------

	The answer is no. For this line of tutorials we will be employing the help of
	header file "vcs.h", in which contains useful definitions of important memory
	space addresses.

	To use this header, all you need to do is add include "vcs.h" at the beginning
	of our assembly files. This works much like the #include macro in C.

	Not only will we be using the "vcs.h" header file. We will also be using the
	the "macro.h" header file. This will provide us with many useful and time
	saving macros.
