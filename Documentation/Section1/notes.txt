The 6502/6507 Microprocessor

	Where as the 6502 uses a 40-pin DIP configuration, the 6507 uses a 28-pin DIP configuration

	These 28-pins allow for:

		- 13-bit address bus
		- 8-bit  data bus (1-byte word size)
	
	The remaining pins are:
		
		- Power
		- CPU timing clock
		- CPU reset
		- Request bus wait states (RDY pin)
		- Read/write commands to memory from the CPU

	*Note: There are NO IRQ or NMI pin on the 6507.*

	
6507 CPU & BUS Overview

	- The CPU ticks 1.19 million times per second
	- each tick is called a clock cycle

	The 6502/6507 contains seven main parts:
		
		- One ALU (arithmetic logic unit)
			- The ALU uses an accumulator register (A register) in-order
			  to consecutively add (accumulate) data from either the GPRs
			  or from memory itself.

			  The ALU then takes that data, acts on an instruction, then
			  either sends it back into the A register or stores it in
			  primary memory.

		- Six addressable registers
			- These are PC, SP, P, X, Y, A
			
			SP & PC registers:
				
				For the most part, every register in a 6502 based processor is 8-bits
				wide. However in the case of the SP and PC registers, they are 16-bits
				wide. This is because the 6502 was designed with the intention of 
				addressing (2 to the 16th) bits of data, or up-to 64Kb of data. 

				Since the SP, or Stack Pointer, is responsible for storing the address
				of the instruction, having a 16-bit address width makes sense.

				In the case of the PC, or the Program Counter, having a 16-bit wide 
				address width makes sense for similar reasons. However, in ther case of
				the PC, it is not the location of the specific instruction that is to be
				stored, but rather the location of the NEXT instruction to be fetched in
				memory. It must be able to loop through all possibly addressable locations
				in memory and thus must be 16-bits wide ad the address bus of the system
				is 16-bits wide (64kb addressable), in-order to accomodate.

				Think of the SP kind of like a pointer in C. It REFERENCES the location
				in memory that the data is stored, or the address of the data stored at the
			        address currently stored in the PC.

			P register:
				
				The P register is known as the Processor State register. It is essentially
				the same as the FLAGS register on 8086 among other microprocessor 
				architectures.
					
					- The P register is split into 8 (really 7) 1-bit boolean "sub
					  registers".

					The values that can be stored within these sub-resigsters are:
					
						n - The negative value flag, stored on the MSB. 		1 = Carry.
						v - The overflow flag, stored on bit 6.				1 = Result Zero
						BLANK	
						b - The break instruction interrupt, stored on bit 4.		1 = Disabled
						d - The decimal mode flag, stored on bit 3.			1 = Decimal Mode
						i - The IRQ disable flag, stored on bit 2.			1 = Break caused interrupt
						z - the zero result flag, stored on bit 1.			1 = Overflow
						c - the carry result flag, stored on the LSB.			1 = Negative


		- Data Bus

			As mentioned in the information above, the 6502 features an 8-bit data bus. This
			means that the 6502 can only act on 00h - FFh of data at a time. This defines
			what we call the word size of the processor, or in-other-words, the word size for
			the 6502 and all its derivatives is 1-byte. 

			The data bus is responsible for moving the data from register to register, or from
			memory to register, and then back again.

		- Address Bus
			
			As exaustively mentioned above, the address bus of the 6502 is 16-bits wide. This 
			means that a 6502 can access up-to 64Kb of data. However, in the case of the ATARI
			VCS's 6507, the address bus is 12-bits wide, meaning that it can only access up-to
			4Kb of data, all-together.

			Where as the Data Bus determines how wide an instruction/data can be, the address
			bus determines the amount of addressable locations that data can be stored and accessed
			from.


	Carry & Overflow

		When the c flag is triggered, when 1 is added to 1, the resulting 1 is then carried to the
		next bit.
