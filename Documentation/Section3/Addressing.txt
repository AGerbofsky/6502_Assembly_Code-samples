Addressing Modes on the 6502/6507

	LDA #80		; Load the Accumulator with the literal value of 80
	LDA $80		; Load the Accumulator with the value stored inside memory address 80h

Pneumonics:

Although these look like the same instruction to us, they are actually two different instructions
to the microprocessor.

The first is called "Immediate Mode". It is where we load directly the value inside the accumulator.
The second is called the "Absolute (Zero Page) Mode". This is where we get an address in the zero
page in memory, and then load the A register with the value stored at that location in memory.

Difference in Opcodes:

	LDA #80		; Translates into A9 50, or 1010 1001  0101 0000, in hex and binary respectively.
	LDA $80		; Translates into A5 80, or 1010 0101  0101 0000, in hex and binary respectively.

Immediate mode (HEX)

	LDA #$80	; Loads the A register with the literal hexadecimal value 80h
                ; 80h is equivalent to 128 in decimal.
