What was ATARI's purpose in designing the TIA Chip?
===================================================

The rational behind the design of the TIA was to aid ATARI to be able to create
a universal "pong" machine. That is to help ATARI to be able to make a machine
that could be programmed to make games similar to PONG, TANK, and Computer
Space, without needing to design discrete hardware each and every time; to 
allow ATARI to create games effortlessly in software, rather than with 
electrical hardware.

What are the components of a VCS game?
======================================

In a normal VCS game you have just a couple of fundimental elements:

	- A background
	- A playfield
	- Player elements
		- Player0
		- player1
		- Missle0
		- Missle1
		- Ball

	Player elements are objects such as those representing player0-1, as
	well as their sub objects, such as missles and balls.

	Player elements have their own colors, positions, etc.

TIA Scanlines and Game Elements
===============================

When we program our games, the TIA scanlines will be rendered based on how we
configure our TIA's screen objects (via the TIA's registers).


Screen Elements in depth
=======================

Background

	- The background takes up the whole visible screen (160x192 px).

	- We can only change the background color per horizontal scanline
	  (COLUBK).

	- The background is always displayed behind all the other screen
	  elements.

Playfield

	- 20-bit pattern, rendered over the left side of the scanline.

	- One color per horizontal scanline.

	- The right side will either REPEAT or REFLECT the same pattern.

	Registers pertaining to the Playfield:

		- PF0, PF1, PF2
		- COLUPF
		- CTRLPF
			- D0: 	 Reflect
			- D1:	 Score
			- D2:	 Priority
			- D4-D5: Ball size (1, 2, 4, 8)
